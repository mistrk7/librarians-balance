#In this page, control the things that this datapack modifies by ONLY changing the number at the end
# 1=Yes, 0=No #

#You can control these values by executing them as commands in-game (recommended)

## Remove Banned Enchantments? (like mending)
scoreboard players set no_mending libal.main 1

## Cap the Enchantment level traded by villagers?
scoreboard players set cap_enchant_level libal.main 1

## Maximum Level Number
scoreboard players set max_level_number libal.main 3

#Extra Info: This datapack also changed some loot tables to make Mending a little more common.
#If this is interferring with something or you don't want this behaviour, you can delete the 'loot_tables' folder.
